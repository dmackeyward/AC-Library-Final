# AC-Library-Final

As part of our Diploma in Software Development we were required to create an application using C++, Qt, and SQLite

This library application was designed for a hypothetical client and features:

The ability for users to register, login, check out books, and return books.
The ability for administrators to login, update the database directly (e.g. users, books, borrowed books)
